        Marktplatz and Bremen Roland Located in the heart of the Old Town
        (Altstadt) - in fact, the beating heart of the Old Town - Bremen's
        picturesque Marktplatz is home to many of the city's top attractions.
        Here, you'll find the lovely old Town Hall, one of the most iconic such
        buildings in Germany. Equally famous is the five-and-a-half-meter-tall
        statue of Germany's most famous knight, Roland. Erected in 1404, the
        statue - the oldest of numerous such monuments dotted around the country
        - remains a symbol of the city's freedom and independence from the
        church (the statue faces the church defiantly).

          Bremen Town HallBremen Town Hall (Bremer Rathaus, also sometimes
          referred to as "City Hall") is a beautiful brick Gothic structure
          built in 1410 in the city's Marktplatz, with its sumptuous Renaissance
          facade added later in 1612. Now designated a UNESCO World Heritage
          Site, the building boasts one of the most elegant banqueting and
          reception halls in Germany, Measuring an impressive 40 meters in
          length, 13 meters across, and eight meters high, its most notable
          feature is a large painting of the Judgment of Solomon dating from
          1537. Also of note is a richly-carved spiral staircase, just one of
          the many features that can be seen up close when you join in one of
          the regular (and extremely informative) guided tours.

        The Cathedral of St. Peter The Cathedral of St. Peter in Bremen - known
        locally as St. Petri Dom - dates from the 11th-century, with later
        additions being made in the 13th and 16th centuries. The exterior, with
        its twin 98-meter-tall towers, was restored in 1898, while its richly
        decorated Baroque pulpit was a gift from Queen Christina of Sweden in
        the 17th century.
