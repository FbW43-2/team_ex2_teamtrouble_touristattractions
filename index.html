      <p>The Klütturm is a lookout tower at <em><b>258 m above sea level</b></em>. NN high mountain Klüt west of Hameln. The tower officially
      bears the name Georgenturm [1], as it was built in 1843 by the civil engineer Adolf Buchholz, who worked in Hameln, from
      stone material from Fort George of the fortifications on the Klüt, which was razed in 1808. In 1887 it was increased to
      23 meters. The viewing platform of the Klütturm can be reached via 99 steps. The tower offers a view of the old town of
      Hameln with the Weser and the middle Weser Uplands.

      <li><b>Kaiser-Wilhelm-Denkmal</b></li>
      
      <p>The Emperor William Monument <em><b>(German: Kaiser-Wilhelm-Denkmal)</b></em> , near the town of Porta Westfalica in the North
      Rhine-Westphalian county of Minden-Lübbecke, is a colossal monument above the Weser gorge of Porta Westfalica, the
      "Gateway to Westphalia". It was erected to honour the first German Emperor, William I (1797–1888), by the then Prussian
      Province of Westphalia between 1892 and 1896[1] and emerged against the background of a rising German national identity.
      The monument, which is around 88 metres (289 ft)[1] high, is classified as one of Germany's national monuments.
